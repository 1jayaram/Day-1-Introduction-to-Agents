# Day-1-Introduction-to-Agents

During the 5-Day AI Agents Intensive Course with Google, I explored the fundamentals of AI Agents by completing codelabs on Kaggle.
Day 1a - From Prompt to Action
Day 1b - Agent Architecture

What I learnt during the 1st day,
1. Explored the foundations of AI agents, agent taxonomy, and the need for Agent Ops and interoperability.
2. Built a simple agent using Gemini and the Agent Development Kit (ADK), and developed a basic multi-agent system.
3. Implemented Google Search integration for up-to-date responses.
