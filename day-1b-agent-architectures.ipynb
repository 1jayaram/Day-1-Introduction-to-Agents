    "\n",
    "Just like a team of people, you can create specialized agents that collaborate to solve complex problems. This is called a **multi-agent system**, and it's one of the most powerful concepts in AI agent development.\n",

    "- ✅ Learn when to use multi-agent systems in [Agent Development Kit (ADK)](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/)\n",
    "- ✅ Build your first system using an LLM as a \"manager\"\n",
    "- ✅ Learn three core workflow patterns (Sequential, Parallel, and Loop) to coordinate your agent teams\n",

That's the promise of Multi-Agent Systems (MAS), and it's about to revolutionize how you develop.\n",
      "\n",
      "MAS allows you to **decompose complexity**. Instead of one giant program, you segment problems into smaller, independent agents, each with a specific role. This modularity makes your code far more maintainable, debugging a breeze, and understanding your system's architecture clearer. Plus, these agents can operate concurrently, unlocking significant performance boosts for demanding applications.\n",
      "\n",
      "Beyond organization, MAS brings **enhanced adaptability and resilience**. Agents can sense their environment and react intelligently to changing conditions, making your software robust. Imagine self-healing systems where components detect failures, reroute tasks, or adapt their behavior autonomously. As agents learn from interactions and data, your software can even evolve its intelligence and efficiency over time.\n",

Instead of tackling a monolithic program, you can segment intricate problems into smaller, independent agents. Each agent is designed with a specific role and responsibility. This modular approach dramatically enhances code maintainability, transforms debugging from a chore into a breeze, and provides a much clearer understanding of your system's architecture.

But tonight, something was different. Tucked behind a stack of worn logbooks, he found it – a rolled parchment, smooth and cool to the touch. Unfurling it, his breath hitched. It wasn’t paper, not quite. It shimmered, a faint, ethereal light pulsing from its surface. Strange symbols, like constellations he’d never seen, swirled across its depths, illuminating a lone, impossibly bright star at its center.

Does he feel a pull to follow it? Giving him a specific action or a more profound internal reaction would flesh out his character and move the plot forward.\n",
      "2.  **Hint at the Map's Purpose/Origin:** The map is mysterious, which is good, but a slight hint about what it might lead to, or where it might have come from, would add intrigue. Is it a treasure map, a star chart leading to a new world, or something else entirely?\n",
      "3.  **Consider the \"What Next\":** The current ending leaves the reader hanging. To make it feel more complete, even as a short piece, you could add a sentence or two that suggests the immediate next step or the dawning realization of what this discovery might mean for Silas and his predictable life.\n",

This was no ordinary map; it pulsed with an ancient energy, a silent invitation to a place beyond the horizon, a place whispered about in the oldest mariners' tales – the Isles of Shifting Stars. A sudden, fierce longing gripped him, a yearning to trade his predictable life for the unknown. Clutching the parchment, Silas turned from the lamp, his gaze fixed on the vast, star-dusted ocean, a decision solidifying within him. The tide might be predictable, but his future no longer was.
